# Unlocking the Power of ARM

Welcome to the "Unlocking the Power of ARM" series repository! This series is dedicated to exploring the vast potential of ARM Cortex microcontrollers, focusing on practical implementations and deep technical insights. Whether you're an experienced developer or just getting started with ARM Cortex, this series will provide valuable knowledge to help you harness the power of ARM-based systems.

## Series Purpose

The goal of this series is to:
- **Educate:** Provide clear and detailed explanations of ARM Cortex architecture and features.
- **Demonstrate:** Showcase practical projects that highlight the capabilities of ARM Cortex microcontrollers.
- **Empower:** Enable developers to confidently use ARM Cortex in their own projects.

## Current Projects

- **ITM Implementation in printf:** Demonstrates how to implement Instrumentation Trace Macrocell (ITM) in the `printf` function, providing a powerful tool for debugging and performance analysis.
  
- **Operational Modes and Access Levels:** This project shows how to manipulate operational modes and access levels of a Cortex-M MCU, with practical examples of switching between user mode, privileged mode, and low-power modes.

- **Instruction Set Architecture & T-bit:** Explores the importance of the T-bit in ARM's Instruction Set Architecture. It demonstrates why invoking a function using a pointer works, but calling the same function directly by address results in a HardFault, diving into the disassembly for insights.

## How to Use This Repository

Each project within this repository is self-contained, with its own set of instructions and source code. To get started, simply navigate to the project folder of interest and follow the provided setup instructions.

Stay tuned for more projects and updates as we continue to unlock the full potential of ARM Cortex!
